### Virtual check-in

Each team will do a virtual check-in in lieu of this week's lab session. Intersect your team's availability Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday of this week and email project mentors to schedule a compatible time. Plan on 20-30 minutes.

During check-in, we'd like to hear from you about:
* How has your first week been?
    * managing remote collaboration
    * adapting your project plan to evolving situation (being scrappy and creative is a plus)
    * acquiring needed hardware, or adjusting/exchanging components as needed 
* How did you do on meeting your week 1 goals?  How do you feel about your path from here to completion?
* What can we do to help you finish strong?
* Start thinking about how to best show off your creation in a video presentation.

Thank you for keeping your momentum up through this unexpected change of plan. Stay safe and well!

### Goals

You're coming down to the finish line now! During lab, we'd like to check in with you to hear how your first week of the project has gone and review your plans for the next week to ensure you are on track for successful completion.

- Assess how well you met your week 1 goal(s)
- Confirm that you have all your hardware
- Begin planning for your demo

Review the [project writeup](/assignments/project/) for information on the project.

### Check in with TA

Before the end of the lab period, be sure to touch base with us on these issues:

* What were your week 1 goals, and did you meet them? (If no, how will you change your plans?)

* How will you show off your creation on the final day?

* If you are not using your PS/2 keyboard for your project, please return it to a TA now.
